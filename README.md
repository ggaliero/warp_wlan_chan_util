# warp_wlan_chan_util

This is a description for all functionalities that were developed during the research project.


- Mango_802.11_RefDes_v1.3.0
  Consists of the source code of Reference Design 802.11 developed by Mango Communications customized to include several
  functionalities.
  1. The wireless channel at which the AP operates may be changed by the UART by pushing c/C on the keyboard. In addition,
     WiFi channels for 5GHz band (Unlicensed) are now accessible. WiFi channels available 1-11, 36, 40, 44, 48.
  2. The RX OFDM entry structured was modified to include the RTP sequence number of a frame generated by a traffic generation
     application. This was done to calculate the unheard frames by the sniffer when running different kind of traffic flows
     between a WARP AP and STA using the experimental framework.

- Mango_802.11_RefDes_v1.3.0_sniffer
  Consist of the source code of Reference Design 802.11 developed by Mango Communications. This is built up from the previous
  software at Mango_802.11_RefDes_v1.3.0.
  It implements a SNIFFER at the AP subproject of Reference Design 802.11. The sniffer presumably captures most of the WiFi
  traffic going over the operation channel. Based on the captured data, calculates the channel occupancy in terms of percentage
  over the measurement time period (by default 1 second). The wireless channel state is assigned based on the previously
  defined metric:
  
      - IDLE: CH_UTIL < 5%
      - LIGHT TRAFFIC: 5% < CH_UTIL < 60%
      - HEAVY TRAFFIC: CH_UTIL > 60%
  

The main goal of this project was to:
- Develop a sniffer which is able to calculate the channel occupancy in terms of percentage over a measurement time period.
- Characterize the wireless channel state based on the aforementioned metric:
      - IDLE: CH_UTIL < 5%
      - LIGHT TRAFFIC: 5% < CH_UTIL < 60%
      - HEAVY TRAFFIC: CH_UTIL > 60%
- Perform dynamic channel allocation for APs, based on the wireless channel state. Specifically, if the channel state is HEAVY
  TRAFFIC over at least 3 seconds, the AP automatically migrates to another WiFi channel where the traffic is less. Previously
  associated STAs will perform automatic reassociation to the AP at the new channel.
  
  
The basic scenario to use the sniffer capabilities is depicted below:
