# warp_wlan_chan_util

This is a description for all functionalities that were developed during the research project.


- Mango_802.11_RefDes_v1.3.0
  Consists of the source code of Reference Design 802.11 developed by Mango Communications customized to include several
  functionalities.
  
    1. The wireless channel at which the AP operates may be changed by the UART by pushing c/C on the keyboard. In addition,
     WiFi channels for 5GHz band (Unlicensed) are now accessible. WiFi channels available 1-11, 36, 40, 44, 48.
    2. The RX OFDM entry structured was modified to include the RTP sequence number of a frame generated by a traffic 
     generation application. This was done to calculate the unheard frames by the sniffer when running different kind of 
     traffic flows between a WARP AP and STA using the experimental framework.

- Mango_802.11_RefDes_v1.3.0_sniffer
  Consist of the source code of Reference Design 802.11 developed by Mango Communications. This is built up from the 
  previous software at Mango_802.11_RefDes_v1.3.0.
  It implements a SNIFFER at the AP subproject of Reference Design 802.11. The sniffer presumably captures most of the WiFi
  traffic (802.11a/g amendments) going over the operation channel. It has two operation modes that may be enabled by 
  selecting the correspondent option indicated at the UART menu.
  
            ********************** AP Menu **********************
            [1] - Interactive AP Status
            [2] - Print Queue Status
            [3] - Print all Observed Statistics
            [4] - Scan channel traffic
            [5] - Channel Utilization

            [c/C] - change channel (note: changing channel will
                    purge any associations, forcing stations to
                    join the network again)
            [r/R] - change default unicast rate
            [s]   - change SSID (note: changing SSID will purge)
                    any associations)
            *****************************************************
  
  Both [4] and [5] enable the sniffer mode of the device, for which the WARP board captured all WiFi frames transmitted 
  along 1 second.
  
  [4] - Scan channel traffic: This mode will show a menu with WiFi channels, 1-11, 36, 40, 44 and 48. For each channel it 
  displays the total number of captured MPDUs (Medium Protocol Data Unit) at the last measurement time period and the 
  cumulative number of MPDUs.
  
  The device performs a sweep over all WiFi channels (2.4 GHz, 5GHz bands). Each sweep lasts 1 second. Then it prints the 
  observed statistics. The sweeps start at CH 1 and loops over the rest to start again at CH 1.

        Scanning channel 11...
        
        [r] - reset statistics
        [w] - increase channel
        [s] - decrease channel
        [c] - confirm channel selection
        
  [r] - Resets the cumulative number of captured MPDUs
  [w] and [s] commands increase or decrease the selected channel with the star '*'. When pushing [c] confirm, the current
  operation stops and then [5] - Channel Utilization menu runs over the channel selected by the star '*'. In this example
  case the selected channel would be CH 1.
        
  [5] - Channel Utilization: This mode will loop over 1 second measurements, for which it captures frames transmitted over  
  the AP operation channel. Then data is processed to print a list with the users which are accessing the channel, showing 
  MAC addresses. The following information is shown for each user:
  
    - Distinction between AP (marked with a star '*') or STA. 
    - Number of captured frames over the measurement time.
    - Transmission time for the frames captured at the measurement time. In other words, how much time was the
      the channel occupied.
    - Cumulative number of captured frames.
    - Power level of the last captured frame.
    - Bad FCS frames: This are the frames which contain bit errors. The information cannot be correctly decoded, but still
      the transmission time that those frames occupy the channel is taken into account.
    
  Eventually it displays: 
    - Total number of captured frames over the measurement time (contribution of all users).
    - TX_TIME.      Total transmission time for all captured frames (contribution of all users) including transmission time 
                    for ACKs and time parameters of the MAC protocol, IFS.
    - TIME_ELAPSED. Time elapsed, which means measurement time.
    - CH_UTIL.       Channel Utilization (%)
    
  The channel utilization is calculated as follows:
  
        CH_UTIL = (TX_TIME / TIME_ELAPSED) * 100 [%]
  
  For each Channel Utilization calculation, the wireless channel state is assigned based on the following thresholds:
  
      - IDLE: CH_UTIL < 5%
      - LIGHT TRAFFIC: 5% < CH_UTIL < 60%
      - HEAVY TRAFFIC: CH_UTIL > 60%
      
  Here is a capture of a real measurement in the Channel Utilization menu:

- Mango_802.11_RefDes_v1.5.2
  It is a newer version of the Reference Design 802.11 by Mango Communications. It includes the same functionalities added
  into the software Mango_802.11_RefDes_v1.3.0, adapted to the new software architecture.
  In addition, a new funtionality is included into STA subproject.

 
The main goal of this project was to:
- Develop a sniffer which is able to calculate the channel occupancy in terms of percentage over a measurement time period.
- Characterize the wireless channel state based on the aforementioned metric:
      - IDLE: CH_UTIL < 5%
      - LIGHT TRAFFIC: 5% < CH_UTIL < 60%
      - HEAVY TRAFFIC: CH_UTIL > 60%
- Perform dynamic channel allocation for APs, based on the wireless channel state. Specifically, if the channel state is HEAVY
  TRAFFIC over at least 3 seconds, the AP automatically migrates to another WiFi channel where the traffic is less. Previously
  associated STAs will perform automatic reassociation to the AP at the new channel.
  
  
The basic scenario to use the sniffer capabilities is depicted below:
